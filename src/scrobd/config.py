"""scrobd's config file, `config.toml` in the XDG config directory.

It holds one setting so far: the library, the folders `scrobd watch` records.

```toml
# Only files under these folders are watched -- the trakt-scrobbler whitelist model.
library = [
    "/mnt/DezLegion2021/Documents/Media/TV_Shows",
    "/mnt/DezLegion2021/Documents/Media/Movies",
]
```

Every mpv starts a watcher, so without a library YouTube, music and clips each
become a session and, unidentified, a question in the review queue. A folder
allowlist was chosen (2026-10-02) over starting the watcher only from mediactl,
which would miss a library file opened from Dolphin.

**A broken config never means "record nothing".** A missing file, or a missing
or empty `library`, is *unscoped*: every local file is recorded, as before there
was a config. A file that cannot be read or parsed is unscoped too, and says so
on stderr. Losing watches to a typo is worse than recording a few extra rows.

**Strings only.** A root is normalised by expanding `~` and folding `.` and
`..`, never by `resolve` or anything else that asks the filesystem: the library
lives on an autofs/sshfs mount that can hang in D state, and a check that
touched it would freeze the watcher with it.
