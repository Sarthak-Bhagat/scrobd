"""Cheapest answer first.

The tiers are ordered by cost and by purity at once: tier 0 does no I/O, tier 1
reads one local file, tier 2 reads another. Tier 3 -- guessit plus a SIMKL
search -- is the only one needing a network and is not implemented here; an
unresolved file returns confidence "none" and goes to the review queue.
