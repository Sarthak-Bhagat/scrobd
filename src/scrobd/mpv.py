"""A minimal client for mpv's JSON IPC.

Newline-delimited JSON over a unix socket. We only ever read: observe a few
properties, then consume the property-change events mpv pushes. No playback
control, so there is nothing here that can disturb what is playing.

`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/mpvsocket`, in the user's own runtime directory, comes from
`input-ipc-server` in mpv.conf and discord.conf. That is a single global option
-- any user script setting it takes the channel over. mpv-discord does this, and
has left the path on disk with nothing behind it. mediactl lost a session's
watch data to that failure presenting as silence, so it raises here.
