"""The one JSON-table-on-disk idiom that index, aliases and queue all share.

Three modules keep a single JSON table on disk, and all three read it the same
way -- a missing or half-written file degrades to an empty table rather than
raising, because a cache miss is recoverable and a crashed daemon is not -- and
write it the same way: to a sibling `.tmp`, then one rename. A reader therefore
sees either the whole old table or the whole new one, never a partial write.

What the three do *not* share is the shape of "empty": the index degrades to
`{"series": {}, "movies": {}}` and the other two to `{}`. So the default is the
caller's to supply, and the caller owns the value it passes -- it is returned
as given, not copied.

Nor do they share *who* the concurrent reader is: the daemon reads the index
and the alias table, the `review` command reads the queue. That is why the
comment naming the reader lives at each call site rather than here.

    `cli._cmd_resolve` -- so the file was neither identified, nor sent, nor
