"""The local record of every session played, one JSON object per line.

**Append-only.** A row is written once and never rewritten, which is why there
is no `watched` field: whether a session counts as watched is derived at read
time from `max_pos / duration`, so changing the threshold later reinterprets
history instead of requiring it to be edited. A 30% abandon is a row like any
other. No sink can hold it; this log can. `duration` and `max_pos` are written
as `null` when mpv never reported them -- a missing number is a gap, a guessed
one is a lie.

**Nothing is discarded for being unidentified.** A session the resolver could
not name is still a row, with empty `ids` and confidence `"none"`, so the watch
survives until the question is answered.

**The dedupe window is measured, not guessed.** Over 5,685 organic plays, the
genuine rewatch rate is 2.22%, and 47% of apparent rewatches are the same
episode logged twice inside a day. A repeat of the same identity within 24
hours is therefore far more likely an artifact than a real second watch, and it
does not become a second row. Past the window, a repeat is a rewatch and is kept.

But that measurement counted *plays* -- completed scrobbles -- and this log
records *sessions*, several of which can make up one play. Stop an episode at
30% and finish it two hours later, and the second session is the same identity
inside the window; dropping it would record a completed watch as an abandon.
So the window removes duplicate plays, not resumes: a repeat inside it is
dropped only if it adds no progress -- its `max_pos` reaches no further than
the furthest already logged for that identity in the window. A session that
reaches further is written. Collapsing several rows of one play into a single
scrobble is the sink's job, later; a few extra rows cost nothing here.

The identity compared is the full one: `ids`, `season` and `episode` together.
A session with **no ids never dedupes**. Two unknowns are not the same thing
just because both are unknown, and folding them would silently drop a watch.

**A corrupt line costs one row, not the log** -- the same promise
`_store.read_table` makes for whole-table files. `read` skips any line that is
not a JSON object, and `record` starts a fresh line if the last write was cut
off mid-line, so one torn write cannot take the next row down with it.

No clock, like `session`: `now` is supplied by the caller, so tests drive the
window directly instead of sleeping.
