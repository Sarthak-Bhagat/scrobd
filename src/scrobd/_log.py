"""A post-mortem trail of what scrobd decided, one JSON object per line.

TEMPORARY. Added 2026-09-21 to run about a week, so that a wrong scrobble can be
reconstructed afterwards rather than re-enacted. `docs/superpowers/logging.md`
says how to read it and when to delete it; `SCROBD_LOG=0` turns it off with no
code change.

**Decisions, never credentials.** Every field written here is something the tool
worked out -- a path, a tier, a library id, a count. Nothing that authenticates
anything belongs in a log line. When the sink layer lands and brings Simkl and
MAL tokens with it, those live in the config file and go nowhere near this
function: the file is plain text, append-only, and read a week later with `jq`.
There is deliberately no redaction pass here to lean on. A guessed redaction
regex hides the leak rather than preventing it; the rule is that a secret is
never passed to `event` in the first place.

**Why this is not inside `resolve()`.** Tier 0 costs no I/O, and
`tests/test_resolver.py::test_tier0_wins_and_costs_no_io` holds it to that by
making `index.load` raise. A log line written from inside the resolver would
touch the disk for every file played, even when the filename alone answered. So
the resolver stays a pure function and its callers -- `cli`, and the daemon once
it exists -- log what came back. `Resolution.source` records which tier won, so
a post-mortem still sees that tier 0 missed and the index caught it.

**One file, no rotation**, because a week of history should be one `jq` away and
rotation puts half of it in a file you forget to look in. Instead of rotating,
the logger warns once on stderr when the file passes `_WARN_BYTES`.
