"""Read the identity straight out of the path. No I/O, no guessing.

Sonarr and Radarr write the id into both the folder and the filename, so this
works for a file that has been moved out of its folder -- which is every file
mediactl trashes, since its trash flattens the hierarchy.

Tag forms seen in this library, all accepted:
    [tvdbid-466998]   Sonarr, current
    [imdbid-tt16428256]  Radarr, current
    [imdb-tt9646546]     Sonarr, pre-2026-09-20; still on archived copies
An empty tag -- [imdb-] -- is not an id. That was a real fault here: Sonarr's
{ImdbId} token renders empty for a series with no imdb entry, while {TvdbId}
is an int and always renders.

`os.path.normpath` below is string arithmetic, not I/O: it never opens, stats
or resolves anything. The "no I/O" promise holds.

    HEURISTIC, and it cannot be made exact. The slot between `SxxExx - ` and the
    episode title holds a bare number, and a bare number is also what a
    resolution and a year look like. Two rules narrow it:

    * reject a value that also appears as a frame height in the same name, so
      `- 1080 - Title [WEBRip-1080p]` yields nothing;
    * reject anything outside 1..1999, so a stray `2024` yields nothing.

    What it cannot catch, stated rather than papered over:

    * a *genuine* absolute of 1080 on a file tagged [WEBDL-1080p] is discarded.
      Real for a long-running anime, and accepted: a missing absolute is a gap
      the sink handles, a wrong one is a wrong scrobble.
    * a genuine absolute above 1999 (Sazae-san territory) is discarded.
    * a bare number in the slot that is neither a year nor a resolution -- a part
      number, or an episode whose title really is `42` -- still reads as an
      absolute. Nothing in the filename distinguishes it.

    Not used: "Sonarr pads to three digits, so a two-digit capture is never
    real". True of every one of the 33 absolute numbers in this library, but it
    would also reject a hand-named file, and the padding is a naming-format
    setting rather than a property of the number.
